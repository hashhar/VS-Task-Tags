# Visual Studio Task Tags

A Visual Studio extension that highlights (and manages) task tags within comments in the Editor Window.

As of now, it simply highlights some predefined tokens using predefined colours. `TODO`, `DEBUG` / `FIXME`, `DOCME`, `TESTME`, `DISCUSS` / `REVIEW` are supported and look like ![this](/Icon.png).

Option to configure the word list and colours will be coming in a future version.

This is an ongoing project and the [roadmap](#roadmap) is detailed below. If you want some features not present in the roadmap feel free to add a GitHub issue or submit a pull-request (Read the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing).
